####Setup Block####
##the first block of code in any R script should (minimally) be a setup block that:
#installs packages
#loads libraries
#sets your working directory

#we will use this script for several sessions.  It is important that the first thing you do is to run the setup block.

#package installs
#this syntax checks if a package is installed, installs it if not.

####Challenge 1####
#Start a new script in your personal branch.  It should include a setup block and a code block.  Make it do something in the code block.  
####Section 7: Data import####
#note the path here.  your working directory should be scripts, so your data is up one (..), then down one to data
#The (..) convention means "up one directory" and is a relative path
#contrast the relative path "../data/heights.csv" 
#with the absolute path "/usr/dgauthie/documents/Github/2024_R_seminar/data/heights.csv"

####Challenge 2####
#Working within your own branch, place copies of your own data files in the /data folder.  
#Add a code block that imports these data files into the Rstudio environment.
####Section 19: Joins####

#data frames for joining
#where do these data sets come from?
flights
airlines

#first, lets make flights a little more convenient for viewing
#introducing both the pipe |> and select() here

flights2 <- flights |> 
  select(year, time_hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier)
flights2

#these two data sets are going to be joined on the common variable ("key") of <carrier>
#the goal here is to append the flights2 dataframe with the full name of each carrier, based on the abbreviation


#checking whether primary key for the joined table uniquely identifies each record
#functions count() and filter()
#these are tidyverse functions, which we'll get to next week in more detail

airlines |> 
  count(carrier) |> 
  filter(n > 1)

#compare above with the unpiped version:
df <- count(airlines, carrier)
  filter(df, n > 1)

#also should examine your keys for missing values 
airlines |> 
  filter(is.na(carrier))

#left join is the most commonly used form of mutating join.  It is often used to add metadata to a data frame
#again, using <carrier> as key

flights2 |>
  left_join(airlines)

#left join (x,y) keeps all observations in x
#if a row in x has more than one match in y, it will be replicated (see 19.4.1)

airlines |>
  left_join(flights2)

#We could also add weather conditions to the flights dataframe
#what key is used?

flights2 |> 
  left_join(weather |> select(origin, time_hour, temp, wind_speed))

#issues with joining: columns mean different things in the joined tables

flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes)

#solution is to re-specify a key that means the same thing in both tables to be joined

flights2 |> 
  left_join(planes, join_by(tailnum))

#can also join based on keys with different names, provided the same values are present 

flights2 |> 
  left_join(airports, join_by(dest == faa))

#Let's join our three penguins data frames

#this isn't what we want
penguins2 <- left_join(penguins_Biscoe, penguins_Torgerson) |>
  left_join(penguins_Dream)
View(penguins2)

#use rbind instead
penguins3 <- rbind(penguins_Biscoe, penguins_Dream, penguins_Torgerson)

#let's convert those "NA" strings
penguins4 <- penguins3 |>
  mutate(across(where(is.character), ~na_if(., "NA")))

#Check to see if it worked
penguins4 |>
  filter(if_any(everything(), ~stringr::str_detect(., "NA")))

#This can also be done at the data import step like so: 
penguins_Torgerson <- read_excel("../data/penguins.xlsx", 
                                 sheet = "Torgersen Island", #note we don't have to use snake case.  Why?
